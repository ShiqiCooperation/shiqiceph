Build Prerequisites
===================

debian-based
------------

The list of debian packages dependencies can be installed with:

	./install-deps.sh

Note: libsnappy-dev and libleveldb-dev are not available upstream for
natty, oneiric, and squeeze.  Backports for Ceph can be found at
ceph.com/debian-leveldb.

rpm-based
---------

The list of RPM packages dependencies can be installed with:

	./install-deps.sh

Building Ceph
=============

Developers, please refer to the [Developer
Guide](doc/dev/quick_guide.rst) for more information, otherwise, you
can build the server daemons, and FUSE client, by executing the
following:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

(Note that the FUSE client will only be built if libfuse is present.)

Dependencies
------------

The configure script will complain about any missing dependencies as
it goes.  You can also refer to debian/control or ceph.spec.in for the
package build dependencies on those platforms.  In many cases,
dependencies can be avoided with --with-foo or --without-bar switches.
For example,

	./configure --with-nss         # use libnss instead of libcrypto++
	./configure --without-radosgw  # do not build radosgw
	./configure --without-tcmalloc # avoid google-perftools dependency


Building packages
-----------------

You can build packages for Debian or Debian-derived (e.g., Ubuntu)
systems with

	sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
	dpkg-checkbuilddeps        # make sure we have all dependencies
	dpkg-buildpackage

For RPM-based systems (Red Hat, SUSE, etc.),

	rpmbuild

Building the Documentation
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------

The list of package dependencies for building the documentation can be
found in doc_deps.deb.txt:

	sudo apt-get install `cat doc_deps.deb.txt`

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation, ensure that you are in the top-level
`/ceph directory, and execute the build script. For example:

	admin/build-doc
