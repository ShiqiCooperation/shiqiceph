Installation Instructions
*************************

When pulling from git, use the --recursive option to include sub-modules:

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceph/ceph.git

And then build the configure script with:

$ ./autogen.sh

Then the usual:

$ ./configure
$ make

Note that if the FUSE library is not found, the user-space fuse client
will not be built.

If you are doing development, you may want to do

$ CXXFLAGS="-g -pg" ./configure

or similar to avoid the default (-g -O2), which includes optimizations
(-O2).
